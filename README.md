Dial a Christmas Carol - for Advent Calendar

You need to have the following installed:

* Python 3.x
* Request
* Flask

You can download the libraries by using the `pip` command
`$ pip install flask`

`$ pip install requests`

Since the `requirements.txt` is included in the repo, you can simply execute the following command

`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`

This will download the required libraries for you.

Finally, run the code on your web server (you'll need to modify the code to include your server details) or run locally using Ngrok.
